# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AppActor Flutter SDK — a Flutter plugin that wraps native AppActorPlugin SDKs (iOS/Android) to provide server-authoritative in-app purchase management. The Dart layer is intentionally thin; most business logic lives in the native SDKs.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Run Dart unit tests
flutter test

# Run a single test file
flutter test test/appactor_flutter_test.dart

# Analyze code (lint)
flutter analyze

# Build example app
cd example && flutter build ios --no-codesign
cd example && flutter build apk

# Run example app
cd example && flutter run
```

**Android native tests:**
```bash
cd android && ./gradlew test
```

## Architecture

### Plugin Channel Bridge Pattern

All Dart-native communication flows through a single `MethodChannel('appactor_flutter')`:

1. **`AppActor`** (`lib/src/appactor.dart`) — Public singleton facade (`AppActor.instance`). Exposes all SDK methods via 7 extensions in `lib/src/extensions/` (lifecycle, identity, purchase, data, config, streams, iOS). Wire method names are constants in `MethodNames` (`lib/src/internal/method_names.dart`), including the 0.0.4 purchase sync additions `quiet_sync_purchases` and `drain_receipt_queue_and_refresh_customer`.

2. **`AppActorPlatform`** (`lib/src/appactor_platform.dart`) — Platform bridge layer. Serializes params to JSON, sends via `invokeMethod('execute', ...)`, deserializes responses. Handles errors by checking for an `error` key in the response JSON and throwing `AppActorError`.

3. **Native plugins** receive an `execute` call with `method` + `json` string, delegate to the native AppActorPlugin SDK, and return a JSON string response. The response JSON has `success` or `error` at the top level. `AppActorPlatform.execute()` extracts the `success` field: if it's a Map, returns as-is; otherwise wraps as `{ 'value': success }` (e.g. booleans from `isConfigured()`).

### Event System

Native-to-Dart events flow through `MethodChannel` handler to broadcast `StreamController`s:
- `customer_info_updated` -> `onCustomerInfoUpdated` stream
- `receipt_pipeline_event` -> `onReceiptPipelineEvent` stream
- `sdk_log` -> auto-printed to console via `debugPrint()` (debug builds only, no listener needed)
- `purchase_intent_received` -> `onPurchaseIntent` stream (iOS only, promoted IAP / win-back offers)
- `deferred_purchase_resolved` -> `onDeferredPurchaseResolved` stream (Ask-to-Buy on iOS, pending purchases on Android)

Malformed events are silently dropped to prevent isolate crashes.

### configure() and Hot Restart

`configure()` is idempotent: it checks `isConfigured()` before proceeding and calls `AppActorPlatform.ensureInitialized()` to re-register the method call handler. This is critical for Flutter hot restart, where the Dart VM restarts but native state persists — the event listener must be re-registered. `reset()` clears both native state and the Dart-side `_searchAdsTrackingEnabled` flag.

### Data Models (`lib/src/models/`)

All models are `@immutable` with manual `fromJson()` factory constructors (no code generation). Error classification uses code ranges: 1000-1999 = plugin errors, 2000+ = SDK errors. Transience is detected by parsing the `detail` string for `transient=true`. Complex dynamic JSON fields (e.g. remote config payloads) use a custom `deep_equals.dart` helper for recursive equality.

### Native Implementations

- **iOS** (`ios/Classes/AppActorFlutterPlugin.swift`): Swift 5.9+, min iOS 15.0, delegates to `AppActorPlugin`, uses `AppActorPluginDelegate` protocol for events. Dependency declared via CocoaPods (`AppActorPlugin`, `0.1.2`), resolved from the iOS SDK git repo.
- **Android** (`android/src/main/kotlin/.../AppActorFlutterPlugin.kt`): Kotlin 2.2.20, minSdk 24, compileSdk 36, JVM target Java 11. Implements `FlutterPlugin` + `ActivityAware`. Dependency: `com.appactor:appactor-plugin:2.3.2`, hosted on Maven Central — no additional authentication required.

### Public API Export

`lib/appactor_flutter.dart` is the single public barrel file — all public types are exported from here.

## Conventions

- Dart SDK constraint: `^3.11.4`, Flutter: `>=3.3.0`
- Linting: `flutter_lints` with `use_null_aware_elements` disabled
- No code generation (no build_runner, freezed, or json_serializable)
- No external state management or DI libraries
- JSON keys use `snake_case` in the wire format
- Enums serialize via `.wireValue` (maps to enum `name`); `fromString()` has fallback defaults for unknown values

## Key Gotchas

- **Version sync required**: `lib/src/sdk_version.dart` (`appActorSdkVersion`) must match `pubspec.yaml` version. Both must be updated on version bumps.
- **Purchase status wire translation**: Native sends `"success"` but Dart enum is `AppActorPurchaseStatus.purchased` — explicit mapping exists in `fromString()`.
- **Search Ads tracking order**: `enableSearchAdsTracking()` must be called BEFORE `configure()`. It is iOS-only but enforced at the Dart level with no platform guard.
- **`toPurchaseParams()` over `toJson()`**: `AppActorPackage.toJson()` is deprecated; use `toPurchaseParams()` for purchase serialization.
- **iOS-only methods throw, not no-op**: Methods in `appactor_ios.dart` (ASA diagnostics, offer code sheet, purchaseFromIntent) throw `UnsupportedError` on non-iOS platforms — they are not silent no-ops.

## Test Strategy

- **Dart unit tests** (`test/`): Focus on model deserialization, error classification, and deep equality. No platform mocking — pure model validation.
- **Android native tests** (`android/src/test/`): Use Mockito to mock `MethodChannel.Result`. Test method routing and error handling. Cannot fully test AppActorPlugin delegation since plugin isn't attached to an engine.
- **Integration tests** (`example/integration_test/`): Sanity checks on real device/simulator (instance availability, configured state, SDK version).
